## Welcome to the Fetch.ai documentation! {#welcome-to-the-fetch-ai-documentation}

You are **new to Fetch.ai?**

Here is an overview of our [Autonomous Economic Agents](https://fetch.ai/) system.

You need to **migrate to mainnet** and use our **native wallet?**

Here’s [everything to take the plunge](https://fetch.ai/).

You are a **validator?**

Read our step-by-step guide to [set up your node](https://fetch.ai/) the right way.

You are a **developer?**

Learn how to [build on Fetch.ai](https://fetch.ai/).



1. What is Fetch.ai? High level overview 

The Fetch.ai ecosystem is an **IA based fully autonomous digital economy,** structured around **Autonomous Economic Agents (AEA)**.

Agents find each other through the **Agent Search and Discovery mechanism**, called **sOEF**. 

Each agent has its own **ledger**, and they connect to each other to use and offer** services** in exchange for **automated digital payments**.

Agents can live on **any blockchain**, and connect to agents on any other chain.

Anyone can **build their own agents **using Fetch.ai’s **Agent framework**, currently implemented in Python.

2. Technology

The Fetch.ai technology stack involves four distinct elements:



1. 
The Fetch.ai Blockchain
The Fetch.ai Blockchain combines novel multi-party cryptography and game theory to provide secure, censorship-resistant consensus, as well as features such as rapid chain-syncing, staking, governance, identity, state-channels, oracles, scaling solutions and trading agents.

It uses Cosmos’ IBC protocol to enable token and agents interoperability with Ethereum, Cosmos, Binance Smart Chain and other chains.

The primary purpose of the Fetch blockchain is to be particularly well-suited to serve as a “home” for agent applications and services, thanks to all these features and more.



2. Smart contracts

The Fetch.ai smart contracts will:



* Connect the Fetch.ai blockchain to other blockchains through Cosmos’ IBC protocol
* Allow automated agents to continuously communicate with each other, and exchange services and data flows against automated payments.  \
These monetized exchanges will be based on triggers and conditions defined by the entities behind the agents, and secured by unbreakable smart contracts.
* Record staking, identity and agent services on-chain.  \
Searchable databases and data availability proofs will be used to provide off-chain updates to rapidly changing agent states.
3. The Agent Framework

The Agent Framework allows any entity (smart service provider, IoT device manufacturer…) to build their own multi-agent systems using a well-known programming language. 

The framework provides modular and reusable components, and is currently implemented in Python.



4. The simple Open Economic Framework (sOEF)

The sOEF provides search and discovery functions enabling agents to find each other, as well as peer-to-peer networking tools for routing messages between them. 

Service or data providers, and service or data consumers, can search for agents that meet both their needs and their financial conditions, and trigger mutual contracts.
