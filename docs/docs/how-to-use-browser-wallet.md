2. In the recipient field enter your native address.

5. After entering all the details, the browser wallet will prompt you to review the operation and approve it if you are happy with it.

That's it! Your transaction will be sent to the native address you input.

To see previous transactions you can also check out one of many different [block explorers](https://explore-fetchhub.fetch.ai/account/fetch1c2wlfqn6eqqknpwcr0na43m9k6hux94dp6fx4y) that have Fetch.ai as an option and input your mainnet address.

**Disclaimer - Although you can access test networks from the browser wallet, do not send TESTFET tokens to a Fetch.ai address on Cosmostation as TESTFET has no value and will not appear.**


## **FAQs**



1. **Can I send my ERC20 FET to this wallet?**

    No. If you do, you will lose your tokens. The wallet can hold native FET tokens and not ERC20.

2. **Can I use this wallet to send tokens from native to ERC20 without requiring a ledger?**

    Yes. This was a highly requested feature from our community and we are happy to confirm you can deposit your native tokens from ledger or cosmostation on the     browser extension wallet and then send it via the [token bridge](https://token-bridge.fetch.ai/) (native to ERC20).

3. **Will this wallet replace the token bridge?**

    No. The token bridge will continue to exist. The wallet will make the process easier to send native to ERC20 tokens without relying on a ledger.

4. **When can I download the Browser extension wallet?**

      Browser extension wallet is available on [Chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fetchai-network-wallet/ellkdbaphhldpeajbepobaecooaoafpg?hl=en-GB).

5. **What are TESTFET tokens?**

    TESTFET tokens do not have an intrinsic value and are purely for the purpose of interacting with testnets. You can get access to TESTFET from the Capricorn testnet [block explorer](https://explore-capricorn.fetch.ai/) with the Token Tap button.
