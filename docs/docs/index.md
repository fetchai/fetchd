# Mainnet is here

The fetchhub mainnet forms the core of the Fetch.ai ecosystem. In these pages, you will find all information to setup your client and connect on the [network](./live-networks/) and [cli-introduction](./cli-introduction/) pages.

This documentation covers some of the things you need to know in order to prepare for and develop on this network.

## Test Networks

The starting point for most will be [our test network](https://docs.fetch.ai/ledger_v2/live-networks/#test-nets), since it can provide you with test tokens with no value, that you can safely experiment with. 

Head over the [Command line client](https://docs.fetch.ai/ledger_v2/cli-introduction/) section for guidance on how to install and configure the `fetchd` client.
