It is now possible for the Fetch.ai Browser Extension Wallet to be used for staking.

**Disclaimer - please note the following:**



**1. As we have been campaigning for decentralization of the network over the past few months and made a lot of progress, we would appreciate it if you could consider staking outside of the top 10 validators and spreading your stake across multiple validators to support making the network as secure as possible for everyone.**

**2. For viewing more information about validators such as their voting power, self bonded rate, uptime, active/inactive validators at any given moments time on the network, descriptions about them (such as their website), and contact information, head over to [this web page](https://bit.ly/32fv1d9) and click on the validator profiles, for a visualization of the validators voting power (more is NOT better) check out [this page](https://bit.ly/3CGe889).**

**3. Don't forget to leave at least 1 $FET undelegated, as some amount of FET is necessary to pay for gas fees when completing any transactions on Mainnet. The fee is extremely minimal, but it is still important to make sure you retain a few FET to pay for any gas fees.**
