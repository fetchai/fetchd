# Concepts

This module represents the verifiable credential core spec. For more information please see the [[core-spec].](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)

Credentials are a part of our daily lives; driver's licenses are used to assert that we are capable of operating a motor vehicle, university degrees can be used to assert our level of education, and government-issued passports enable us to travel between countries. This specification provides a mechanism to express these sorts of credentials on chain in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable.
