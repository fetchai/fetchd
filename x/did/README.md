# DID Module 


This module implements the DID core spec. For more information please see the [DID W3C core-spec](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/).

Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID identifies any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) that the controller of the DID decides that it identifies.

A DID is a globally unique persistent identifier that does not require a centralized registration authority and is often generated and/or registered cryptographically.
 

The DID module provides the functionalities to create and manage the lifecycle of a DID document on chain.
